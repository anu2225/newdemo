🧪 1️⃣ Tester Part (Your Main Speech)

"From a testing perspective, we’re validating each automation flow independently — especially the AI enrichment and CRM sync, which are more complex areas.

We’re using Postman and custom scripts to test API responses and webhook triggers. For AI enrichment, we validate the output quality using predefined benchmarks to make sure the results are accurate.

Each automation step has logging enabled. If any step fails, the system automatically captures the error and sends alerts to the team through Slack or email.

We’re also running performance tests to ensure the system can handle high lead volumes smoothly and without latency issues.

Additionally, we performed functional, integration, and API testing to make sure each module works correctly and communicates properly with the others.

We also ran negative testing to check if the error-handling and alert mechanisms trigger properly during failures.

Overall, the workflows are stable, error-free, and performing well. The system passed all major test cases successfully, and we’re confident the automation is ready to move into the next phase."

🧾 2️⃣ Slide 8 – Phase 1 Deliverables Summary

"This slide highlights our key deliverables from Phase 1.

First, we completed a detailed requirements analysis — mapping all client needs to the most suitable tools and platforms.

Second, we finalized the platform selection report, confirming Make.com as the main platform based on its strong automation, scalability, and integration capabilities.

Third, we designed a high-level architecture diagram that shows how Apollo, Clearbit, and Salesforce interact within the automation flow.

And lastly, we created an integration mapping that defines each tool’s role, required APIs, and how data flows between systems.

Overall, Phase 1 gave us a strong foundation to confidently move ahead into content development and Phase 2."

🧭 3️⃣ Slide 9 – Phase 2 Preview: Content & Methodology

"Now moving to Phase 2 — this stage will focus on content and refining our proposal.

We’ll develop two to three case studies that show how similar B2B SaaS automation projects improved lead quality, response rates, and sales cycle efficiency.

Along with that, we’ll follow our proven project methodology: starting from Discovery, moving into Architecture Design, then Build and Testing, and finally Deployment with proper training and support.

This structured approach ensures our solution stays scalable, reliable, and aligned with client goals as we move forward."

💡 Tips for You

Speak slowly and confidently (around 3–4 minutes total).

Small smile and natural tone — like explaining, not reading.

End your part with:
