Dear Team,


We’ve been entrusted with a high-priority strategic opportunity—a fast-growing B2B SaaS company is seeking a comprehensive sales and marketing automation system. This aligns perfectly with our strengths in Make.com, n8n, AI integrations, and Salesforce.


I will be leading the overall proposal development and client coordination. Please find below the key project details and initial task assignments:

 

Project Scope Overview

Client Requirements:

Lead Sourcing
AI Enrichment & Qualification
CRM Integration
Personalized Outreach
Technical Focus:

Platform evaluation: Make.com vs. n8n
Integration tools: Apollo, Clearbit, Salesforce
Architecture: High-level flow design with automation logic
 

Team Deliverables

Phase 1 – Deep Requirements Analysis (Due Today):

Action: Review the four core client needs.
Focus: Determine which of their needs are best met by Make.com (due to its complex flow handling) versus a lighter tool like n8n. Draft a proposed high-level architecture diagram.
Output: A high-level document mapping each requirement to the most suitable platform and third-party tools. Include a draft architecture diagram.
Phase 2 – Collateral & Content Gathering (Due Tomorrow):

Action: Compile relevant case studies (2–3) showcasing similar SaaS automation projects.
Process Outline: Adapt our standard methodology: Discovery → Architecture → Build/Test → Deploy/Train
 

Next Steps

Please acknowledge receipt of this assignment.
Confirm availability for the internal sync on Thursday at 3:00 PM.
Let’s aim to have the full draft ready for my review by Friday, 5:00 PM.

Thank you all for your involvement and collaboration.


Best regards,
Sangavi M
